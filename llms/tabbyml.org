#+Title: Peteches TabbyML Conifg

* TabbyML
[[https://tabby.tabbyml.com][TabbyML]] is a locally hosted coding assistant.
This config isn't exported by default as I automate the deployment of my configs. Sadly the API
Token cannot be configured outside this TOML file as far as I can see which means I either
- Commit my API Token into git.. Big No.
- Have to edit my config file every day after the automated config deployment, Also No.
- Manually export this config file and add the token in then.. I suppose this is the best option.

  Potentially there are some GPG options I could run down, but I can't be bothered right now.
